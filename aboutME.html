    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <p>I am a Bachelor degree holder in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. 
        I studied at the University of San Antonio, Texas, and graduated with honors
        in 2022. I interned at NASA for 6 months in the fall of 2021. I minored in graphic
        design and interior design. I have taken my certificate exams and am a certified 
        electrical engineer. Your projects are in good hands. Worry not.
